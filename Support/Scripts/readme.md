UNOFFICIAL!

These unofficial scripts enable certain tasks to be performed programmatically when supporting the General Bytes' CAS.
It is designed to openly expose all commands and procedures being performed on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS servers, while reducing the CLI knowledge requirements of server administrators. 
In many instances, this tool can be used for setting up CAS or repairing damaged installs, as well adding new features as desired by the operator.
